BFM FOR SPI
             A System Verilog Bus Functional Model (BFM) for SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a simulation model used to emulate the behavior of SPI communication within a digital system during the verification and testing phase. It allows designers to simulate and validate the operation of SPI interfaces without needing physical hardware. 
Creating a Bus Functional Model (BFM) for SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) in System Verilog involves defining a module that emulates the behavior of an SPI slave or master device for simulation and verification purposes.
A well-designed System Verilog BFM for SPI is a powerful tool for verifying the functionality and compliance of SPI interfaces within digital designs, ensuring they operate correctly according to the SPI protocol and the specific requirements of the project.
